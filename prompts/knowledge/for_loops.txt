=== Python For Loops ===

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, 
a dictionary, a set, or a string).
2. This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
3. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
4. Print each fruit in a fruit list:
5. The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.
- Note: The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.
