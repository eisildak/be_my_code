📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
2. These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
3. An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
4. If statement:
5. In this example we use two variables, a and b,
which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a.
As a is 33, and b is 200,
we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- Note: You can use spaces or tabs for indentation, but you must use the same amount of indentation for all statements within the same code block.

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

```
