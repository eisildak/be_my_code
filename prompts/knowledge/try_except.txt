=== Python Try Except ===
Konu: try_except

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. The try block lets you test a 
block of code for errors.
2. The except block lets you 
handle the error.
3. The else block lets you 
execute code when there is no error.
4. The finally block lets you 
execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.
5. When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and 
generate an error message.
