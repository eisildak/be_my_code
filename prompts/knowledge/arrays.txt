1. Note: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, 
  but Python Lists can be used instead.
2. Note: This page shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import
  a library, like the NumPy library.
3. Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable:
4. Create an array containing car names:
5. An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
