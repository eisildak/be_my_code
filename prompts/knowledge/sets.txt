📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
2. Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of 
data, the other 3 are List, 
Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
3. A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
4. * Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove 
  items and add new items.
5. Sets are written with curly brackets.

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- * Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove 
  items and add new items.
- Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which 
  order the items will appear.
- Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items 
and add new items.
- Note: The values True
  and 1 are considered the same value in sets, 
  and are treated as duplicates:
- Note: The values False
  and 0 are considered the same value in sets, 
  and are treated as duplicates:
- *Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new 
  items.
**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. 
  In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
