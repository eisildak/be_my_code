📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. Variables are containers for storing data values.
2. Python has no command for declaring a variable.
3. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
4. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
5. If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- You will learn more about 
  data types and
  casting later in this tutorial.

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

Örnek 1:
```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```

Örnek 2:
```python
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
```

Örnek 3:
```python
x = 
  str(3)    # x will be '3'y = int(3)    # y 
  will be 3z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
```

Örnek 4:
```python
x = 5y = "John"print(type(x))print(type(y))
```

Örnek 5:
```python
x = "John"# is the same asx = 
  'John'
```

Örnek 6:
```python
a = 4A = 
  "Sally"#A will not overwrite a
