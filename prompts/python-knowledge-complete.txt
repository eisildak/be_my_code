=== Python Syntax ===
Konu: syntax
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_syntax.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
2. Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:
3. Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
4. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability 
only, the indentation in Python is very important.
5. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

================================================================================


=== Python Variables ===
Konu: variables
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. Variables are containers for storing data values.
2. Python has no command for declaring a variable.
3. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
4. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
5. If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- You will learn more about 
  data types and
  casting later in this tutorial.

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

Örnek 1:
```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)

x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)
```

Örnek 3:
```python
x = 
  str(3)    # x will be '3'y = int(3)    # y 
  will be 3z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
```

Örnek 4:
```python
x = 5y = "John"print(type(x))print(type(y))
```

Örnek 5:
```python
x = "John"# is the same asx = 
  'John'
```

Örnek 6:
```python
a = 4A = 
  "Sally"#A will not overwrite a
```

=== Python Data Types ===
Konu: datatypes
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. In programming, data type is an important concept.
2. Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do 
different things.
3. Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
4. You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:
5. Print the data type of the variable x:

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

Örnek 1:
```python
x = 5
print(type(x))
```

================================================================================


=== Python Numbers ===
Konu: numbers
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_numbers.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. There are three numeric types in Python:
2. Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:
3. To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:
4. Int, or integer, is a whole number, 
positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
5. Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- Note: You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

Örnek 1:
```python
x = 1    
  # inty = 2.8  # floatz = 1j   # complex
```

```

================================================================================


=== Python Casting ===
Konu: casting
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_casting.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.
2. Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

Örnek 1:
```python
x = int(1)   # x will be 1
y = int(2.8) # y will be 2
z = int("3") # z will be 3
```

Örnek 2:
```python
x = float(1)     # x will be 1.0
y = float(2.8)   # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")   # z will be 3.0
w = float("4.2") # w will be 4.2
```

Örnek 3:
```python
x = str("s1") # x will be 's1'
y = str(2)    # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'
```

================================================================================


=== Python Strings ===
Konu: strings
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
2. 'hello' is the same as "hello".
3. You can display a string literal with the print() function:
4. You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:
5. Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by 
an equal sign and the string:

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- Note: in the result, the line breaks are inserted at the same position as in the code.

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

Örnek 1:
```python
print("Hello")
print('Hello')
```

Örnek 2:
```python
print("It's alright")

  eiusmod tempor incididuntut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""print(a)
```

Örnek 5:
```python
a = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,consectetur adipiscing elit,sed do 
  eiusmod tempor incididuntut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''print(a)
```

Örnek 6:
```python
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])
```

Örnek 7:
```python
for x in "banana":  print(x)
```

Örnek 8:
```python
a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))
```

Örnek 9:
```python

```

Örnek 10:
```python
txt = "The best things in life are free!"if "free" in txt: 
print("Yes, 'free' is present.")
```

Örnek 11:
```python
txt = "The best things in life are free!"print("expensive" not in txt)
```

Örnek 12:

=== Python Booleans ===
Konu: booleans
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_booleans.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. Booleans represent one of two values: 
True or False.
2. In programming you often need to know if an expression is 
True or False.
3. You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two 
answers, 
True or False.
4. When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns 
the Boolean answer:
5. When you run a condition in an if statement, Python returns 
True or False:

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

=== Python Operators ===
Konu: operators
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
2. In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
3. Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or two variables:
4. Python divides the operators in the following groups:

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

Örnek 1:
```python
print(10 + 5)
```

Örnek 2:

4. Create a List:
5. List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.
- *Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items 
  whenever you like.
**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. 
  In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

3. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
4. Tuples are written with round brackets.
5. Create a Tuple:

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- *Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items 
  whenever you like.
**As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. 
  In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

=== Python If Statement ===
Konu: conditions
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
2. These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
3. An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
4. If statement:
5. In this example we use two variables, a and b,
which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a.
As a is 33, and b is 200,
we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- Note: You can use spaces or tabs for indentation, but you must use the same amount of indentation for all statements within the same code block.

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

Örnek 1:

=== Python While Loops ===
Konu: while_loops
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. Python has two primitive loop commands:
2. With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
3. Print i as long as i is less than 6:
4. Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.
5. The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, 
which we set to 1.

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

Örnek 1:
```python
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
```

Örnek 2:
```python
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
    if i == 3:    break  i += 1
```

Örnek 3:
```python
i = 0
while i < 6:
    i += 1
  if i == 3:    continue  print(i)

=== Python For Loops ===
Konu: for_loops
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, 
a dictionary, a set, or a string).
2. This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
3. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
4. Print each fruit in a fruit list:
5. The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.
- Note: The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

=== Python Functions ===
Konu: functions
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
2. A function can return data as a result.
3. A function helps avoiding code repetition.
4. In Python, a function is defined using the def 
keyword, followed by a function name and parentheses:
5. This creates a function named my_function that prints "Hello!" when called.

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- The code inside the function must be indented. Python uses indentation to define code blocks.
- It's good practice to use descriptive names that explain what the function does.
- If a function doesn't have a return statement, it returns None by default.

=== Python range ===
Konu: range
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_range.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. The built-in range() function returns an immutable sequence of numbers, commonly used for looping a specific number of times.
2. This set of numbers has its own data type called range.
3. The range() function can be called with 1, 2, or 3 arguments, using this syntax:
4. range(start, stop, step)
5. If the range function is called with only one argument, the argument represents the stop value.
The start argument is optional, and if not provided, it defaults to 0.
range(10) returns a sequence of each number from 0 to 9. (The start argument, 0 is inclusive, and the stop argument, 10 is exclusive).

Example
Create a range of numbers from 0 to 9:

x = range(10)

Try it Yourself »


Call range() With Two Arguments
If the range function is called with two arguments,
    the first argument represents the start value,
    and the second argument represents the stop value.
range(3, 10) returns a sequence of each number from 3 to 9:

Example
Create a range of numbers from 3 to 9:

x = range(3, 10)

Try it Yourself »


Call range() With Three Arguments
If the range function is called with three arguments, the third argument represents the step value.
The step value means the difference between each number in the sequence. It is optional, and if not provided, it defaults to 1.
range(3, 10, 2) returns a sequence of each number from 3 to 9, with a step of 2:

Example
Create a range of numbers from 3 to 9:

x = range(3, 10, 2)

Try it Yourself »


Using ranges
Ranges are often used in for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.

Example
Iterate over each value in a range:

for i in range(10):
  print(i)

Try it Yourself »


Using List to Display Ranges
The range object is a data type that represents an immutable sequence of numbers, and it is not directly displayable.
Therefore, ranges are often converted to lists for display.

Example
Convert different ranges to lists:

print(list(range(5)))
print(list(range(1, 6)))
print(list(range(5, 20, 3)))

Try it Yourself »


Slicing Ranges
Like other sequences, ranges can be sliced to extract a subsequence.

Example
Extract a subsequence from a range:

r = range(10)
print(r[2])
print(r[:3])

Try it Yourself »

Note: The first print statement returns the value at index 2, and the second print statement returns a new range object, from index 0 to 3.

Membership Testing
Ranges support membership testing with the in operator.

Example
Test if the numbers 6 and 7 are present in a range:

r = range(0, 10, 2)
print(6 in r)
print(7 in r)

Try it Yourself »

The return value is True when the number is present in the range, and False when it is not.

Length
Ranges support the len() function to get the number of elements in the range.

Example
Get the length of a range:

r = range(0, 10, 2)
print(len(r))

  but Python Lists can be used instead.
2. Note: This page shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import
  a library, like the NumPy library.
3. Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable:
4. Create an array containing car names:
5. An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:

=== Python Iterators ===
Konu: iterators
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_iterators.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.
2. An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can 
traverse through all the values.
3. Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the 
iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() 
and __next__().
4. Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable
containers which you can get an iterator from.
5. All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator:

=== Python Modules ===
Konu: modules
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_modules.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. Consider a module to be the same as a code library.
2. A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
3. To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py:
4. Save this code in a file named mymodule.py
5. Now we can use the module we just created, by using the import statement:

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- Note: When using a function from a module, use the syntax: module_name.function_name.
- Note: The dir() function can be used on all 
  modules, also the ones you create yourself.
- Note: When importing using the from 
  keyword, do not use the module name when referring to elements in the module.

=== Python Try Except ===
Konu: try_except
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_try_except.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. The try block lets you test a 
block of code for errors.
2. The except block lets you 
handle the error.
3. The else block lets you 
execute code when there is no error.
4. The finally block lets you 
execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.
5. When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and 
generate an error message.

=== Python String Formatting ===
Konu: string_formatting
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_string_formatting.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. F-String was introduced in Python 3.6,
and is now the preferred way of formatting strings.
2. Before Python 3.6 we had to use the format() method.
3. F-string allows you to format selected parts of a string.
4. To specify a string as an f-string, simply put an f in front of the string 
literal, like this:
5. Create an f-string:

=== Python None ===
Konu: none
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_none.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. None is a special constant in Python that represents the absence of a value.
2. Its data type is NoneType, and None is the only instance of a NoneType object.
3. Variables can be assigned None to indicate "no value" or "not set".
4. Assign and display a None value:
5. Use type() to see the type of a None value.

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

Örnek 1:
```python
x = None
print(x)
```

Örnek 2:
```python
x = None
print(type(x))
```

Örnek 3:
```python
result = None
if result is None:
  print("No result yet")
else:
  print("Result is ready")
```

Örnek 4:
```python
result = None
if result is not None:
  print("Result is ready")
else:
  print("No result yet")
```

Örnek 5:

  x = 5

x = myfunc()
print(x)
```

================================================================================


=== Python User Input ===
Konu: user_input
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_user_input.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. Python allows for user input.
2. That means we are able to ask the user for input.
3. The following example asks for your name, and when you enter a name, it gets printed on the screen:
4. Ask for user input:
5. Python stops executing when it comes to the input() function, and continues 
when the user has given some input.

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- Python stops executing when it comes to the input() function, and continues 
when the user has given some input.

💻 KOD ÖRNEKLERİ:

Örnek 1:
```python
print("Enter your name:")
name = input()
print(f"Hello {name}")
```

Örnek 2:
```python
name = input("Enter your name:")
print(f"Hello {name}")
```

Örnek 3:
```python
name = input("Enter your name:")
print(f"Hello {name}")
fav1 = input("What is your favorite animal:")
fav2 = input("What is your favorite color:")
fav3 = input("What is your favorite number:")
print(f"Do you want a {fav2} {fav1} with {fav3} legs?")
```

Örnek 4:
```python
x = input("Enter a number:")

#find the square root of the number:
y = math.sqrt(float(x))

print(f"The square root of {x} is {y}")
```

Örnek 5:
```python
y = True
while y == True:
  x = input("Enter a number:")
  try:    x = float(x);    y = False  
  except:    print("Wrong input, please try again.")

print("Thank you!")
```

=== Python Virtual Environment ===
Konu: virtualenv
Kaynak: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_virtualenv.asp

📖 AÇIKLAMALAR:
1. A virtual environment in Python is an isolated environment on your computer, where you can run and test your Python projects.
2. It allows you to manage project-specific dependencies without interfering with other projects or the original Python installation.
3. Think of a virtual environment as a separate container for each Python project. Each container:
4. Using virtual environments is important because:
5. Python has the built-in venv module for creating virtual environments.

⚠️ ÖNEMLİ NOTLAR:
- Note: The virtual environment myfirstproject still exists, it is just not activated.
  If you activate the virtual environment again, you can execute the test.py
  file, and the diagram will be displayed.
